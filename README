        lpcisp -- NXP ISP programming tool

lpcisp is intended to be a clean and flexible way to identify, erase, read, and write
NXP LPC-family components which support serial ISP (In-System Programming) mode.

The basic usage is:
        lpcisp [options] device

The device argument is the serial device used to communicate with the
target processor.  All options are preceded by a dash.  To get the
current complete list of options invoke the program with no arguments.

Please note:
        1) on exit the target is reset.  If reset isn't mapped the GO command is invoked to
        	attempt to jump to address 0x00000000.
        2) the set of supported devices is incomplete and some may be inaccurate.  Adding
                more parts is simply a matter of adding lines to the list.  See partdesc.c.
                Please forward changes and additions via:
                   https://github.com/andrewpines/lpcisp/issues
        3) some devices are more finicky about the oscillator setting and baud rate than
                others.  if it has trouble communicating try reducing the baud rate.
        4) some devices (LPC2134, for instance) don't seem to communicate correctly unless
                the echo option is enabled.  The transfer is much faster with echo off, so
                it's off by default.  If the device identifies correctly but fails to
                acknowledge the transfer of blocks of data try enabling echo.

OPTIONS

Following is a list of the available options:

-reset ctrl     map the reset function to a serial device signal.  ctrl may be
                one of dtr, ndtr, rts, or nrts.  lpcisp will assert (dtr, rts)
                or negate (ndtr, nrts) the selected signal to reset the target.
                Default is none.

-isp ctrl       map the ISP function to a serial device signal.  ctrl may be
                one of dtr, ndtr, rts, or nrts.  lpcisp will assert (dtr, rts)
                or negate (ndtr, nrts) the selected signal to invoke ISP on the
                target.  Default is none.

-hold           if invoked the ISP signal will be held through the programming
                sequence.  this is for systems where the signal is used to take
                competing serial devices off the bus during programming.  Default
                is to negate ISP immediately after reset at start of programming
                sequence.

-baud rate      set the baud rate to be used for communicating with the target
                device.  Default is 115200.

-tbaud rate     set the baud rate to be used for terminal mode.  Default is 115200.

-clock rate     set the clock rate of the target device, in kHz.  Default is
                12000 (12MHz).

-retry num      set the number of times to attempt to sync to the target device.
                each attempt times out after about one second so this is
                essentially the number of seconds to try to connect to the target
                before aborting.  Default is 25.

-bin filename   load a binary file to be written to or compared against the flash
                memory of the target device.  Always loads at address 0x00000000.

-hex filename   load an intel hex file to be written to or compared against the flash
                memory of the target device.  Does not need to begin at address
                0x00000000 but if it is to be written to the target it does need
                to start on a page boundary.  This restriction may someday be lifted
                if an application appears where it would be useful.

-vector         LPC parts require vector 7 to be the 2's complement of the sum of
                vectors 0 through 6.  If the image starts at address 0x00000000 this
                is filled in automatically.  if the image does not start at 0x00000000
                but the beginning of the image is the vector table then this option
                will force the patching of vector 7 at the beginning of the image.

-erase          erase the target device (all sectors).

-echo           enable command echo (disabled by default).

-write          write the loaded file to flash on the target.

-verify         compare the loaded file with the flash on the target.  Note that this
                does not require writing the file first though if it is used without
                first writing the code it requires that code read protect is disabled.

-dump address length      dump a block of memory from the device.  Address may be anywhere
                within the device but it must be word-algned (multiple of four).  Length
                must also be word-aligned.  If this is executed without erase/write then
                code read protect must be disabled.

-term           after completion of other operations reset the target and drop to a
                terminal to communicate with it.  The baud rate is set by the -tbaud
                option.  Pressing <ESC> will reset the target (if -reset was configured)
                and pressing <CTRL-X> will exit.  All other key codes are passed to the
                target.

-verbose level  set the reporting level (0-4):
                  0: errors only.
                  1: minimum (only what was expressly requested, just memory dump).
                  2: information; basic information about devices and process.  This is the default.
                  3: debug process; details about the various tasks being executed.
                  4: debug full; complete dump of data exchanged with target.
                all messages at or below the selected level will be displayed (e.g., if level
                is set to 2 then messages at levels 0, 1, and 2 will be displayed).

-parts          dump a list of supported parts.

================================================

EXAMPLES

        ID
                The target processor can be identified without performing any operations on it.
                Assume:
                  the target has its reset signal connected to DTR
                  the target has its ISP signal connected to RTS
                  the serial device is /dev/ttyS0
                The command would be:
                  lpcisp -reset ndtr -isp nrts /dev/ttyS0

                Note that DTR and RTS are inverted.  This is the correct mapping if they are
                connected directly to the outputs of an RS232-to-logic level converter.

                if successful lpcisp will report something like the following:
                  device information:
                     part number:  LPC1112FHN33/[101|102]
                     ID:           0x2524d02b
                     flash size:   16384 bytes
                     SRAM size:    2048 bytes
                     UID:          f5000001 4ff53bb2 53581b51 0707212d
                     boot version: 1.7

                The ID, UID and boot version are read from the part.  The rest are looked up
                based on the ID.


        Erase
                To erase the device from the previous example the command would be:
                  lpcisp -reset ndtr -isp nrts -erase /dev/ttyS0


        Write
                The most common task is to write an image to a device.  To write an Intel
                hex file named image.hex to the target device in the above examples the
                command would be:
                  lpcisp -reset ndtr -isp nrts -hex image.hex -erase -write /dev/ttyS0


        Verify
                To verify the code after writing in the above example simply add the -verify
                option:
                  lpcisp -reset ndtr -isp nrts -hex image.hex -erase -write -verify /dev/ttyS0

                Alternatively, a previously-written image can be verified against a hex file
                if code protect is disabled.  This will report the result but will not alter
                the target device:
                  lpcisp -reset ndtr -isp nrts -hex image.hex -verify /dev/ttyS0


        Dump
                Similar to verify, a block of word-aligned memory can be dumped out.  To
                read 256 bytes starting at address 0x000200 from the target device in the
                previous examples the command would be:
                  lpcisp -reset ndtr -isp nrts -dump 0x200 256  /dev/ttyS0

                Note that the address and length arguments can be either decimal or hex
                (preceded by 0x).  Again, this only works after erasing the entire device
                or if code read protect is disabled.

        Terminal
                A serial terminal may be opened after other operations are complete.  Reset
                and ISP are left in their negated states.  The baud rate is set by the
                -tbaud option.  The terminal can be entered without other operations.  The
                command would be:
                  lpcisp -reset ndtr -isp nrts -tbaud 9600 -term /dev/ttyS0
