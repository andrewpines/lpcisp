Build should be as simple as:
	make clean
	make
	make install

You may need root permissions to install; it simply copies the
executable to /usr/local/bin.

lpcisp should build with no warnings.  If you see any warnings please
report them via the link below.

lpcisp tries to use just minimal C library support, so it doesn't
depend on anything unusual.  It's been tested on OS X and Linux. No
effort has been made to build it under Windows.  The system-specific
bits should be limited to asyncserial.c, so porting shouldn't be
overly difficult.  If you manage to make it build under Windows and
want your changes rolled into a future version please send them via
this contact page:
