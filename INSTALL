Building on Unix-based systems (Linux, OSX) should be as simple as:
	make clean
	make
	make install

You may need root permissions to install; it simply copies the
executable to /usr/local/bin.

To build on Windows (Visual Studio Build Tools):
	nmake /C /F Makefile.vc clean
	nmake /C /F Makefile.vc

lpcisp should build with no warnings.  If you see any warnings please
report them via the link below.

lpcisp been extensively tested on OS X and Linux but has only recently
been ported to Windows so it hasn't been tested as thoroughly there
yet.  Please report any issues here:
